# IndyAWS Meetings

Welcome to the meetings repository for IndyAWS.

## Structure of the Repository

Each month we will upload the slides from that months meeting into a directory named with the year and month. All meeting notes are written in Markdown and the slides are generated with [Hovercraft](https://hovercraft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I've been using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) to convert to ReStructuredText.

The `docs` subdirectory contains general documentation such as meeting topic suggestions. The docs can be served up in real-time using [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org). Doing this during the meeting allows for live editing and updating of the text when using the `mkdocs serve` command.
